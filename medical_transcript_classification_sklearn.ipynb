The patient had a positive hCG with a negative sonogram and hCG titer of about 18,000.,HOSPITAL COURSE:,  The patient was admitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of a possible incomplete abortion, to rule out ectopic pregnancy or rupture of corpus luteal cyst.  The patient was kept in observation for 24 hours.  The sonogram stated there was no gestational sac, but there was a small mass within the uterus that could represent a gestational sac.  The patient was admitted to the hospital.  A repeat hCG titer done on the same day came back as 15,000, but then the following day, it came back as 18,000.  The diagnosis of a possible ruptured ectopic pregnancy was established.  The patient was taken to surgery and a laparotomy was performed with findings of a right ruptured ectopic pregnancy.  The right salpingectomy was performed with no complications.  The patient received 2 units of red packed cells.  On admission, her hemoglobin was 12.9, then in the afternoon it dropped to 8.1, and the following morning, it was 7.9.  Again, based on these findings, the severe abdominal pain, we made the diagnosis of ectopic and it was proved or confirmed at surgery.  The hospital course was uneventful.  There was no fever reported.  The abdomen was soft.  She had a normal bowel movement.  The patient was dismissed on 09/09/2007 to be followed in my office in 4 days.,FINAL DIAGNOSES:,1.  Right ruptured ectopic pregnancy with hemoperitoneum.,2.  Anemia secondary to blood loss.,PLAN: , The patient will be dismissed on pain medication and iron therapy.&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Obstetrics / Gynecology&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Discharge Summary&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;1385&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is a 62-year-old white female with multiple chronic problems including hypertension and a lipometabolism disorder.  She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself.  She continues to gain weight.  Diabetes is therefore a major concern.  In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes.  The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today.  One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.  She has rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help.  She does admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She was told that she does snore.  She does not smoke.  As stated, she has gained significant weight.,GYNECOLOGICAL HISTORY: , She does not bleed.  She has both ovaries, as well as her uterus and cervix.  She is on no hormonal therapy.,PREVENTATIVE HISTORY:,  She is not exercising.  She does not do self breast examinations.  She has recently had her mammogram and it was unremarkable.  She does take her low-dose aspirin daily as well as her multivitamin.  She does wear her seatbelt.  As previously noted, she does not smoke or drink alcohol.,PAST MEDICAL, FAMILY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Per health summary sheet, unchanged.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Unremarkable with the exception of that above. ,ALLERGIES: , No known drug allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Benicar 20 mg daily; multivitamin; glucosamine; vitamin B complex; vitamin E and a low-dose aspirin.,OBJECTIVE:,General:  Well-nourished, well-developed, a very pleasant 61-year-old in no acute distress.,Vitals:  Her weight today is 246 pounds.  In March of 2002 she weighed 231 pounds.  In March 2001 she weighed 203 pounds.  Her blood pressure is 160/78.  Pulse is 84.  Respiratory rate of 20.  She is afebrile.,HEENT:  Head is of normocephalic, atraumatic.  PERLA.  Conjunctivae clear.  TMs are unremarkable and canals are patent.  Nasal mucosa is slightly reddened.  Nares are patent.  Throat shows some clear posterior pharyngeal drainage.  Throat is slightly reddened.  Non-exudative.  No oral lesions or dental caries noted.,Neck:  Supple, No adenopathy.  Thyroid without any nodules or enlargements, no JVD or carotid bruits.,Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, clicks or rubs.  PMI is nondisplaced.,Lungs:  Clear to A&amp;amp;P.  No CVA tenderness.,Breast exam:  Negative for any axillary nodes, skin changes, discrete nodules or nipple discharge.  Breasts were examined both lying and sitting.,Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly or masses.  Non tender.,Pelvic exam:  BUS unremarkable.  Speculum exam shows normal physiologic discharge.  There are some atrophic vaginal changes.  Cervix visualized, no gross abnormalities.  Pap smear obtained.  Bimanual is negative for any adnexal masses or tenderness.  Rectal exam is negative for any adnexal masses or tenderness.  No rectal masses.  She does have some external hemorrhoids, none of which are inflamed at this time.  No palpable rectal masses.,Neuromusculoskeletal exam:  Cranial nerves II-XII are grossly intact.  No cerebellar signs are noted.  No evidence of a gait disturbance.  DTRs are 1+/4+ and equal throughout.  Good uptoeing.  Skin:  Inspection of her skin, subcuticular tissues negative for any concerning skin lesions, rashes or subcuticular masses.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Weight-gain.,2.  Hypertension.,3.  Lipometabolism disorder.,4.  Rectal bleeding.,5.  Left knee pain.,6.  Question of sleep apnea.,7.  Upper respiratory infection, improving.,8.  Gynecological examination is unremarkable for her age.,PLAN:,  We discussed at length, the issue of sleep apnea and its negative sequela.  I have recommended that she be referred for a sleep study.  She is certainly at risk for sleep apnea.  She refuses this.  I do not think that her upper respiratory tract infection needs any further treatment at this time since she is feeling better.  I did x-ray her knee and with the exception of some degenerative changes, it was unremarkable.  I reviewed this with her.  I do think that since she is having rectal bleeding, while this is not real unusual for her, with her family history of colon cancer, I am going to have her discuss this further with Dr. XYZ and leave further studies up to them.  I will dictate Dr. XYZ a note.  I am not going to order any further studies at this time in terms of her yellow stools and right upper quadrant discomfort.  She has had a gallbladder sonogram done in the past, this has been unremarkable and these symptoms really have not changed for her.  This however, has been some time ago.  I suspect she has an element of irritable bowel syndrome.  I have strongly encouraged weight reduction, both through diet and exercise.  I would like to see her back in the office in six months.  I did retake her blood pressure today and it was 130/70.  She is fasting this morning, so we will get a fasting blood sugar, chem-12, lipid profile, and CPK.  I will her mail the results.  I have strongly encouraged medication management if her lipids are elevated.  I think she is amenable to this.  Her DEXA scan is up to date having been done on 04/09/03.  I do not recommend one this year.&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;SOAP / Chart / Progress Notes&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;General Medicine&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;2604&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;ADMISSION DIAGNOSES:,1.  Menorrhagia.,2.  Uterus enlargement.,3.  Pelvic pain.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: , Status post vaginal hysterectomy.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 36-year-old, gravida 3, para 3 female who presented initially to the office with abnormal menstrual bleeding and increase in flow during her period.  She also had symptoms of back pain, dysmenorrhea, and dysuria.  The symptoms had been worsening over time.  The patient was noted also to have increasing pelvic pain over the past 8 months and she was noted to have uterine enlargement upon examination.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient underwent a total vaginal hysterectomy.,HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient was admitted on 09/04/2007 to undergo total vaginal hysterectomy.

This shows an entirely normal transformation zone, so no biopsies are taken.  An endocervical curettage is then performed with Cytobrush and curette and sent to pathology.  Colposcopy of the vulva is then performed again with acetic acid.  There is a thin strip of acetowhite epithelium located transversely on the clitoral hood that is less than a centimeter in diameter.  There are absolutely no abnormal vessels within this area.  The vulvar colposcopy is completely within normal limits.,A/P: , ASCUS Pap smear with history of a cone biopsy in 1993 and normal followup.,We will check the results of the Pap smear, in addition we have ordered DNA testing for high-risk HPV.

The patient will be followed up with result of colonoscopy.&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;SOAP / Chart / Progress Notes&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;General Medicine&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;1385&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is a 62-year-old white female with multiple chronic problems including hypertension and a lipometabolism disorder.  She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself.  She continues to gain weight.  Diabetes is therefore a major concern.  In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes.  The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today.  One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.  She has rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help.  She does admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She was told that she does snore.  She does not smoke.  As stated, she has gained significant weight.,GYNECOLOGICAL HISTORY: , She does not bleed.  She has both ovaries, as well as her uterus and cervix.  She is on no hormonal therapy.,PREVENTATIVE HISTORY:,  She is not exercising.  She does not do self breast examinations.  She has recently had her mammogram and it was unremarkable.  She does take her low-dose aspirin daily as well as her multivitamin.  She does wear her seatbelt.  As previously noted, she does not smoke or drink alcohol.,PAST MEDICAL, FAMILY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Per health summary sheet, unchanged.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Unremarkable with the exception of that above. ,ALLERGIES: , No known drug allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Benicar 20 mg daily; multivitamin; glucosamine; vitamin B complex; vitamin E and a low-dose aspirin.,OBJECTIVE:,General:  Well-nourished, well-developed, a very pleasant 61-year-old in no acute distress.,Vitals:  Her weight today is 246 pounds.  In March of 2002 she weighed 231 pounds.  In March 2001 she weighed 203 pounds.  Her blood pressure is 160/78.  Pulse is 84.  Respiratory rate of 20.  She is afebrile.,HEENT:  Head is of normocephalic, atraumatic.  PERLA.  Conjunctivae clear.  TMs are unremarkable and canals are patent.  Nasal mucosa is slightly reddened.  Nares are patent.  Throat shows some clear posterior pharyngeal drainage.  Throat is slightly reddened.  Non-exudative.  No oral lesions or dental caries noted.,Neck:  Supple, No adenopathy.  Thyroid without any nodules or enlargements, no JVD or carotid bruits.,Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, clicks or rubs.  PMI is nondisplaced.,Lungs:  Clear to A&amp;amp;P.  No CVA tenderness.,Breast exam:  Negative for any axillary nodes, skin changes, discrete nodules or nipple discharge.  Breasts were examined both lying and sitting.,Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly or masses.  Non tender.,Pelvic exam:  BUS unremarkable.  Speculum exam shows normal physiologic discharge.  There are some atrophic vaginal changes.  Cervix visualized, no gross abnormalities.  Pap smear obtained.  Bimanual is negative for any adnexal masses or tenderness.  Rectal exam is negative for any adnexal masses or tenderness.  No rectal masses.

Lipometabolism disorder.,4.  Rectal bleeding.,5.  Left knee pain.,6.  Question of sleep apnea.,7.  Upper respiratory infection, improving.,8.  Gynecological examination is unremarkable for her age.,PLAN:,  We discussed at length, the issue of sleep apnea and its negative sequela.  I have recommended that she be referred for a sleep study.  She is certainly at risk for sleep apnea.  She refuses this.  I do not think that her upper respiratory tract infection needs any further treatment at this time since she is feeling better.  I did x-ray her knee and with the exception of some degenerative changes, it was unremarkable.  I reviewed this with her.  I do think that since she is having rectal bleeding, while this is not real unusual for her, with her family history of colon cancer, I am going to have her discuss this further with Dr. XYZ and leave further studies up to them.  I will dictate Dr. XYZ a note.  I am not going to order any further studies at this time in terms of her yellow stools and right upper quadrant discomfort.  She has had a gallbladder sonogram done in the past, this has been unremarkable and these symptoms really have not changed for her.  This however, has been some time ago.  I suspect she has an element of irritable bowel syndrome.  I have strongly encouraged weight reduction, both through diet and exercise.  I would like to see her back in the office in six months.  I did retake her blood pressure today and it was 130/70.  She is fasting this morning, so we will get a fasting blood sugar, chem-12, lipid profile, and CPK.  I will her mail the results.  I have strongly encouraged medication management if her lipids are elevated.  I think she is amenable to this.  Her DEXA scan is up to date having been done on 04/09/03.  I do not recommend one this year.&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;SOAP / Chart / Progress Notes&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;General Medicine&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n                    &lt;/div&gt;\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;/tr&gt;\n        &lt;/tbody&gt;\n        \n        &lt;tbody class=&quot;first:border-t border-b border-zinc-400&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;tr class=&quot;gsk-issue text-sm group peer text-left cursor-pointer hover:bg-zinc-700&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;td class=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; stroke-width=&quot;1.5&quot;\n                        stroke=&quot;currentColor&quot; class=&quot;w-4 h-4 group-[.open]:rotate-90&quot;&gt;\n                        &lt;path stroke-linecap=&quot;round&quot; stroke-linejoin=&quot;round&quot; d=&quot;M8.25 4.5l7.5 7.5-7.5 7.5&quot; /&gt;\n                    &lt;/svg&gt;\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n                &lt;td class=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;code class=&quot;mono text-blue-300&quot;&gt;\n                    transcription contains &amp;#39;cervix&amp;#39;\n                &lt;/code&gt;\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n                &lt;td class=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;\n                    Precision = 0.12\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n                &lt;td class=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;span class=&quot;text-red-400&quot;&gt;\n                        -81.55% than global\n                    &lt;/span&gt;\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n                &lt;td class=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;span class=&quot;text-gray-400&quot;&gt;\n                        21 samples (5.66%)\n                    &lt;/span&gt;\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n                &lt;td class=&quot;p-3 text-xs text-right space-x-1&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;\n                        class=&quot;gsk-debug inline-block border border-emerald-100/50 text-emerald-100/90 hover:bg-emerald-500 hover:border-emerald-500 hover:text-white px-2 py-0.5 rounded-sm&quot;&gt;Debug&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;/tr&gt;\n            &lt;tr class=&quot;gsk-issue-detail text-left collapse peer-[.open]:visible border-b border-zinc-400 bg-zinc-700&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;td colspan=&quot;6&quot; class=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;h4 class=&quot;uppercase&quot;&gt;Examples&lt;/h4&gt;\n                    &lt;div class=&quot;text-white max-w-xl text-sm overflow-scroll&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 920px&quot;&gt;\n                        &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;dataframe&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;transcription&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;medical_specialty&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;predicted_label&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;2605&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  The patient comes for her first Pap smear, complaining of irregular periods.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient wishes to discuss considering something to help with her menstrual cramping and irregular periods.

She also notes that her headaches have been worsening a little bit.  She has had quite a bit of stress.  She had a headache on Wednesday again after having had one on the weekend.  She said she usually only has an occasional headache and that is not too bad but now she has developed what she would consider to be a migraine and she has not had serious headaches like this and it seems to be worsening and coming a little bit more regularly, and she has not figure out what to do to get rid of them.

The incision was enlarged.  A 5-mm trocar placed through the incision without problem.  Laparoscope placed through the trocar.  Pelvic contents visualized.  A 2nd puncture was made 2 fingerbreadths above the symphysis pubis in the midline.  Under direct vision, the trocar was placed in the abdominal cavity.  Uterus, tubes, and ovaries were all normal.  There were no pelvic adhesions, no evidence of endometriosis.  Uterus was anteverted and the right adnexa was placed on a stretch.  The tube was grasped 1 cm from the cornual region, care being taken to have the bipolar forceps completely across the tube and the tube was coagulated using amp meter for total desiccation.  The tube was grasped again and the procedure was repeated for a separate coagulation, so that 1.5 cm of the tube was coagulated.  The structure was confirmed to be tube by looking at fimbriated end.  The left adnexa was then placed on a stretch and the procedure was repeated again grasping the tube 1 cm from the cornual region and coagulating it.  Under traction, the amp meter was grasped 3 more times so that a total of 1.5 cm of tube was coagulated again.  Tube was confirmed by fimbriated end.  Gas was lend out of the abdomen.  Both punctures repaired with 4-0 Vicryl and punctures were injected with 0.5% Marcaine 10 mL.

GC and chlamydia cultures as well as a repeat Pap smear were done.,Colposcopy is then performed without and with acetic acid.  This shows an entirely normal transformation zone, so no biopsies are taken.  An endocervical curettage is then performed with Cytobrush and curette and sent to pathology.  Colposcopy of the vulva is then performed again with acetic acid.  There is a thin strip of acetowhite epithelium located transversely on the clitoral hood that is less than a centimeter in diameter.  There are absolutely no abnormal vessels within this area.

While here she had a couple of other issues as well.  She stated that she has been having some right shoulder pain.  She denies any injury but certain range of motion does cause it to hurt.  No weakness, numbness or tingling.  As far as her diabetes she states that she only checks her blood sugars in the morning and those have all been ranging less than 100.  She has not been checking any two hours after meals.  Her blood pressures when she does check them have been running normal as well but she does not have any record of these present with her.  No other issues or concerns.  Upon review of her chart it did show that she had a benign breast biopsy done back on 06/11/04 and was told to have a repeat mammogram in six months but she has never had that done so she is needing to have this done as well.,ALLERGIES: , None.,MEDICATIONS:,  She is on Hyzaar 50/12.5 one-half p.o. daily, coated aspirin daily, lovastatin 40 mg one-half tab p.o. daily, multivitamin daily, metformin 500 mg one tab p.o. b.i.d.; however, she has been skipping her second dose during the day.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  She is a nonsmoker.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  As noted above.,OBJECTIVE:,Vital Signs:  Temperature:  98.2.

Gait and station were not tested.,MENTAL STATUS:  Shows the patient to be alert, coherent with full capacity for decision making.,BACK:  Negative to inspection or percussion.,LABORATORY DATA: , Shows from 12/15/08 2100, hemoglobin 11.6, white count 12.9, and platelets 126,000.  INR 1.0.  Electrolytes are normal with exception potassium 3.3.  GFR is decreased at 50 with creatinine of 1.1.  Glucose was 119.  Magnesium was 2.3.  Phosphorus 3.8.  Calcium was slightly low at 7.8.  The patient has had ionized calcium checked at Munson that was normal at 4.5 prior to her discharge.  Troponin is negative x2 from 2100 and repeat at 07:32.  This morning, her BNP was 163 at admission.  Her admission chest x-ray was unremarkable and did not show evidence of cardiomegaly to suggest pericardial effusion.  Her current EKG tracing from 05:42 shows a sinus bradycardia with Wolff-Parkinson White Pattern, a rate of 58 beats per minute, and a corrected QT interval of 557 milliseconds.  Her PR interval was 0.12.,We received a call from Munson Medical Center that a bed had been arranged for the patient.  I contacted Dr. Varner and we reviewed the patient&#x27;s managed to this point.  All combined impression is that the patient was likely to not have had actual ventricular tachycardia.  This is based on her EP study from October showing her to be non-inducible.  In addition, she had a cardiac catheterization that showed no evidence of coronary artery disease.  What is most likely that the patient has postoperative atrial fibrillation.  Her WPW may have degenerated into a ventricular tachycardia, but this is unlikely.  At this point, we will convert the patient from IV amiodarone to oral amiodarone and obtain an echocardiogram to verify that she does not have evidence of pericardial effusion in the postoperative period.  I will recheck her potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus at this point and make adjustments if indicated.  Dr. Varner will be making arrangements for an outpatient Holter monitor and further followup post-discharge.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.,2.

Hypokalemia.,CLINICAL RESUME: , This 83 year-old woman who presented to the ER with complaints of nausea, vomiting, and epigastric discomfort, ongoing for about 4 to 5 months.  She has had extensive work up and had her gallbladder removed on April 22, 2007, and had an endoscopy, which had demonstrative gastric ulcer disease apparently about a year ago.  She has had abdominal CAT scan and gastric emptying studies which was normal.,A CT scan of the abdomen done on her May 9, 2007, which showed bilateral peripelvic renal cysts and a redundant sigmoid colon.  Otherwise unremarkable.  The patient follows with Dr. XYZ as an outpatient.  The patient had some worsening of her symptoms over the last few days and then came to the ER.  She was admitted.  Please refer to Dr. XYZ initial H&amp;amp;P for complete details.,HOSPITAL COURSE:,1.  Epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting.  The patient was restituted with antiemetics and her symptoms improved.  It was not clear whether her nausea and abdominal pain were due to gastritis, peptic ulcer disease/gastric ischemia, or cardiac origin.  A brain MRI was also done which basically showed a tiny focus of abnormal enhancement in the pons, which could be subacute like infarct.  However, brain neoplasm could not be excluded.  Other workup including a CT angio did not show any evidence of acute pulmonary emboli.  It showed some moderate cardiomegaly with bilateral pleural effusions, and a small pericardial effusion.  The patient underwent Cardiolite stress test but finished only the resting studies, which was inconclusive.  She refused to complete the stress test.  She was seen by Dr. XYZ in consultation who recommended that the patient should have a small bowel follow through and eventually angiogram as an outpatient.,2.  Congestive heart failure exacerbation.  The patient was treated with ACE inhibitors, diuretics, Aldactone, and Lasix, and improved.  An echocardiogram done showed an ejection fraction of about 30% to 35%, mild water decrease in LV systolic function, with multiple segmental wall motion abnormalities, a small anterior pericardial effusion, but no electrocardiographic signs of cardiac tamponade.  There was some pseudo normal pattern of filling, mild MR and global hypokinesis of the LV.,3.  Small pericardial effusion.  The patient did not have any clinical or echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.,4.  Hypothyroidism.  TSH was quite elevated at 19.,5.  Questionable subacute infarct versus neoplasm in the pons on an MRI of the head.,6.  History of coronary artery disease/angioplasty and stents.,7.  Hyperkalemia.,8.  Patient was doing well.  She was back to her baseline and was refusing further workup and the patient was stable and it was felt she could be safely discharged home to have further testing done as an outpatient.,MEDICATIONS AND ADVICE ON DISCHARGE:,1.  She is to continue taking Coreg 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.,2.  Cozaar 50 mg p.o. daily.,3.  Aldactone 25 mg p.o. daily.,4.  Synthroid 0.075 mg p.o. daily.,5.  Carafate 1 gram p.o.  4 times a day.,6.

She is to follow up with Dr. XYZ her cardiologist in 1 to 2 days&#x27; time.  She is to follow up with Dr. XYZ from GI as scheduled.  The patient was advised that she will need a small bowel follow through with angiogram which can be arranged by her gastroenterologist as an outpatient.  She was also advised that she would need a repeat MRI of her head in 2 to 3 months&#x27; time.  She will also need repeat echocardiogram done in one month for a pericardial effusion.  This can be arranged by her primary care physician.  Repeat TSH to be done in 6 weeks&#x27; time.,Over 35 minutes were spent in the patient discharged.&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;General Medicine&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Discharge Summary&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n                    &lt;/div&gt;\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;/tr&gt;\n        &lt;/tbody&gt;\n        \n        &lt;tbody class=&quot;first:border-t border-b border-zinc-400&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;tr class=&quot;gsk-issue text-sm group peer text-left cursor-pointer hover:bg-zinc-700&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;td class=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; stroke-width=&quot;1.5&quot;\n                        stroke=&quot;currentColor&quot; class=&quot;w-4 h-4 group-[.open]:rotate-90&quot;&gt;\n                        &lt;path stroke-linecap=&quot;round&quot; stroke-linejoin=&quot;round&quot; d=&quot;M8.25 4.5l7.5 7.5-7.5 7.5&quot; /&gt;\n                    &lt;/svg&gt;\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n                &lt;td class=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;code class=&quot;mono text-blue-300&quot;&gt;\n                    transcription contains &amp;#39;improved&amp;#39;\n                &lt;/code&gt;\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n                &lt;td class=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;\n                    Precision = 0.17\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n                &lt;td class=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;span class=&quot;text-red-400&quot;&gt;\n                        -74.69% than global\n                    &lt;/span&gt;\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n                &lt;td class=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;span class=&quot;text-gray-400&quot;&gt;\n                        32 samples (8.63%)\n                    &lt;/span&gt;\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n                &lt;td class=&quot;p-3 text-xs text-right space-x-1&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;\n                        class=&quot;gsk-debug inline-block border border-emerald-100/50 text-emerald-100/90 hover:bg-emerald-500 hover:border-emerald-500 hover:text-white px-2 py-0.5 rounded-sm&quot;&gt;Debug&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;/tr&gt;\n            &lt;tr class=&quot;gsk-issue-detail text-left collapse peer-[.open]:visible border-b border-zinc-400 bg-zinc-700&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;td colspan=&quot;6&quot; class=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;h4 class=&quot;uppercase&quot;&gt;Examples&lt;/h4&gt;\n                    &lt;div class=&quot;text-white max-w-xl text-sm overflow-scroll&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 920px&quot;&gt;\n                        &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;dataframe&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;transcription&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;medical_specialty&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;predicted_label&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;3933&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:,1.  Respiratory failure improved.,2.  Hypotension resolved.,3.  Anemia of chronic disease stable.,4.  Anasarca improving.,5.  Protein malnourishment improving.,6.  End-stage liver disease.,HISTORY AND HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient was admitted after undergoing a drawn out process with a small bowel obstruction.  His bowel function started to improve.  He was on TPN prior to coming to Hospital.  He has remained on TPN throughout his time here, but his appetite and his p.o. intake have improved some.  The patient had an episode while here where his blood pressure bottomed out requiring him to spend multiple days in the Intensive Care Unit on dopamine.  At one point, we were unsuccessful at weaning him off the dopamine, but after approximately 11 days, he finally started to tolerate weaning parameters, was successfully removed from dopamine, and has maintained his blood pressure without difficulty.  The patient also was requiring BiPAP to help with his oxygenation and it appeared that he developed a left-sided pneumonia.  This has been treated successfully with Zyvox and Levaquin and Diflucan.  He seems to be currently doing much better.  He is only using BiPAP in the evening.  As stated above, he is eating better.  He had some evidence of redness and exquisite swelling around his genital and lower abdominal region.  This may be mainly dependent edema versus anasarca.  The patient has been diuresed aggressively over the last 4 to 5 days, and this seems to have made some improvement in his swelling.  This morning, the patient denies any acute distress.  He states he is feeling good and understands that he is being discharged to another facility for continued care and rehabilitation.  He will be discharged to Garden Court skilled nursing facility.,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS/INSTRUCTIONS:,  He is going to be going with Protonix 40 mg daily, metoclopramide 10 mg every 6 hours, Zyvox 600 mg daily for 5 days, Diflucan 150 mg p.o. daily for 3 days, Bumex 2 mg p.o. daily, Megace 400 mg p.o. b.i.d., Ensure 1 can t.i.d. with meals, and MiraLax 17 gm p.o. daily.  The patient is going to require physical therapy to help with assistance in strength training.  He is also going to need respiratory care to work with his BiPAP.  His initial settings are at a rate of 20, pressure support of 12, PEEP of 6, FIO2 of 40%.  The patient will need a sleep study, which the nursing home will be able to set up.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  On the day of discharge, heart rate 99, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 102/59, temperature 98.2, O2 sat 97%.,GENERAL:  A well-developed white male who appears in no apparent distress.,HEENT:  Unremarkable.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Positive S1, S2 without murmur, rubs, or gallops.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes or crackles.,ABDOMEN:  Positive for bowel sounds.  Soft, nondistended.  He does have some generalized redness around his abdominal region and groin.  This does appear improved compared to presentation last week.  The swelling in this area also appears improved.,EXTREMITIES:  Show no clubbing or cyanosis.  He does have some lower extremity edema, 2+ distal pedal pulses are present.,NEUROLOGIC:  The patient is alert and oriented to person and place.  He is alert and aware of surroundings.  We have not had any difficulties with confusion here lately.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  The patient moves all extremities without difficulty.  He is just weak in general.,LABORATORY DATA: , Lab work done today shows the following:  White count 4.2, hemoglobin 10.2, hematocrit 30.6, and platelet count 184,000.  Electrolytes show sodium 139, potassium 4.1, chloride 98, CO2 26, glucose 79, BUN 56, and creatinine 1.4.  Calcium 8.8, phosphorus is a little high at 5.5, magnesium 2.2, albumin 3.9.,PLAN:  ,Discharge this gentleman from Hospital and admit him to Garden Court SNF where they can continue with his rehab and conditioning.  Hopefully, long-term planning will be discharge home.  He has a history of end-stage liver disease with cirrhosis, which may make him a candidate for hospice upon discharge.  The family initially wanted to bring the patient home, but he is too weak and requires too much assistance to adequately consider this option at this time.&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Discharge Summary&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;General Medicine&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;3440&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Complex open wound right lower extremity complicated by a methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cellulitis.,ADDITIONAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Chronic pain.,2.  Tobacco use.,3.  History of hepatitis C.,REASON FOR ADMISSION:,  The patient is a 52-year-old male who has had a very complex course secondary to a right lower extremity complex open wound.  He has had prolonged hospitalizations because of this problem.  He was recently discharged when he was noted to develop as an outpatient swollen, red tender leg.  Examination in the emergency room revealed significant concern for significant cellulitis.  Decision was made to admit him to the hospital.,HOSPITAL COURSE:,  The patient was admitted on 03/26/08 and was started on IV antibiotics elevation, was also counseled to minimizing the cigarette smoking.  The patient had edema of his bilateral lower extremities.  The hospital consult was also obtained to address edema issue question was related to his liver hepatitis C.  Hospital consult was obtained.  This included an ultrasound of his abdomen, which showed just mild cirrhosis.  His leg swelling was thought to be secondary to chronic venostasis and with likely some contribution from his liver as well.  The patient eventually grew MRSA in a moderate amount.  He was treated with IV vancomycin.  Local wound care and elevation.  The patient had slow progress.  He was started on compression, and by 04/03/08 his leg got much improved, minimal redness and swelling was down with compression.  The patient was thought safe to discharge home.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: , The patient was discharged on doxycycline 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. x10 days.  He was also given prescription for Percocet and OxyContin, picked up at my office.  He is instructed to do daily wound care and also wrap his leg with an Ace wrap.  Followup was arranged in a couple of weeks.,DISCHARGE CONDITION: , Stable.&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;General Medicine&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Discharge Summary&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;1311&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;PROBLEM LIST:,1.  Refractory hypertension, much improved.,2.  History of cardiac arrhythmia and history of pacemaker secondary to AV block.,3.  History of GI bleed in 1995.,4.  History of depression.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a return visit to the renal clinic for this patient.  She is an 85-year-old woman with history as noted above.  Her last visit was approximately four months ago.  Since that time, the patient has been considerably more compliant with her antihypertensive medications and actually had a better blood pressure reading today than she had had for many visits previously.  She is not reporting any untoward side effect.  She is not having weakness, dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.  She has no orthopnea.  Her exercise capacity is about the same.  The only problem she has is musculoskeletal and that pain in the right buttock, she thinks originating from her spine.  No history of extremity pain.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,1.  Triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide 37.5/25 mg.,2.  Norvasc 10 mg daily.,3.  Atenolol 50 mg a day.,4.  Atacand 32 mg a day.,5.  Cardura 4 mg a day.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 36.2, pulse 47, respirations 16, and blood pressure 157/56.  THORAX:  Revealed lungs that are clear, PA and lateral without adventitious sounds.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Demonstrated regular rate and rhythm.  S1 and S2 without murmur.  No S3.  I could not hear murmur today.  ABDOMEN:  Above plane, but nontender.  EXTREMITIES:  Revealed no edema.,ASSESSMENT:,  This is a return visit for this patient who has refractory hypertension.  This seems to be doing very well given her current blood pressure reading, at least much improved from what she had been previously.  We had discussed with her in the past beginning to see an internist at the senior center.  She apparently had an appointment scheduled and it was missed.  We are going to reschedule that today given her overall state of well-being and the fact that she has no evidence of GFR that is greater than 60%.,PLAN: , The plan will be for her to follow up at the senior center for her routine health care, and should the need arise for further management of blood pressure, a referral back to us.  In the meantime, we will discharge her from our practice.  Should there be confusion or difficulty getting in the senior center, we can always see her back in followup&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;SOAP / Chart / Progress Notes&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;General Medicine&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n                    &lt;/div&gt;\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;/tr&gt;\n        &lt;/tbody&gt;\n        \n        &lt;tbody class=&quot;first:border-t border-b border-zinc-400&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;tr class=&quot;gsk-issue text-sm group peer text-left cursor-pointer hover:bg-zinc-700&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;td class=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; stroke-width=&quot;1.5&quot;\n                        stroke=&quot;currentColor&quot; class=&quot;w-4 h-4 group-[.open]:rotate-90&quot;&gt;\n                        &lt;path stroke-linecap=&quot;round&quot; stroke-linejoin=&quot;round&quot; d=&quot;M8.25 4.5l7.5 7.5-7.5 7.5&quot; /&gt;\n                    &lt;/svg&gt;\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n                &lt;td class=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;code class=&quot;mono text-blue-300&quot;&gt;\n                    transcription contains &amp;#39;sensory&amp;#39;\n                &lt;/code&gt;\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n                &lt;td class=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;\n                    Precision = 0.18\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n                &lt;td class=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;span class=&quot;text-red-400&quot;&gt;\n                        -73.32% than global\n                    &lt;/span&gt;\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n                &lt;td class=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;span class=&quot;text-gray-400&quot;&gt;\n                        31 samples (8.36%)\n                    &lt;/span&gt;\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n                &lt;td class=&quot;p-3 text-xs text-right space-x-1&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;\n                        class=&quot;gsk-debug inline-block border border-emerald-100/50 text-emerald-100/90 hover:bg-emerald-500 hover:border-emerald-500 hover:text-white px-2 py-0.5 rounded-sm&quot;&gt;Debug&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;/tr&gt;\n            &lt;tr class=&quot;gsk-issue-detail text-left collapse peer-[.open]:visible border-b border-zinc-400 bg-zinc-700&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;td colspan=&quot;6&quot; class=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;h4 class=&quot;uppercase&quot;&gt;Examples&lt;/h4&gt;\n                    &lt;div class=&quot;text-white max-w-xl text-sm overflow-scroll&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 920px&quot;&gt;\n                        &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;dataframe&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;transcription&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;medical_specialty&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;predicted_label&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;2882&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.

Epidural hematoma, cervical spine.,2.  Status post cervical laminectomy, C3 through C7 postop day #10.,3.  Central cord syndrome.,4.  Acute quadriplegia.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Evacuation of epidural hematoma.,2.  Insertion of epidural drain.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,200 cc.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 64-year-old female who has had an extensive medical history beginning with coronary artery bypass done on emergent basis while she was in Maryland in April of 2003 after having myocardial infarction.  She was then transferred to Beaumont Hospital, at which point, she developed a sternal abscess.  The patient was treated for the abscess in Beaumont and then subsequently transferred to some other type of facility near her home in Warren, Michigan at which point, she developed a second what was termed minor myocardial infarction.,The patient subsequently recovered in a Cardiac Rehab Facility and approximately two weeks later, brings us to the month of August, at which time she was at home ambulating with a walker or a cane, and then sustained a fall and at that point she was unable to walk and had acute progressive weakness and was identified as having a central cord syndrome based on an MRI, which showed record signal change.  The patient underwent cervical laminectomy and seemed to be improving subjectively in terms of neurologic recovery, but objectively there was not much improvement.  Approximately 10 days after the surgery, brings us to today&#x27;s date, the health officer was notified of the patient&#x27;s labored breathing.  When she examined the patient, she also noted that the patient was unable to move her extremities.  She was concerned and called the Orthopedic resident who identified the patient to be truly quadriplegic.  I was notified and ordered the operative crew to report immediately and recommended emergent decompression for the possibility of an epidural hematoma.  On clinical examination, there was swelling in the posterior aspect of the neck.  The patient has no active movement in the upper and lower extremity muscle groups.  Reflexes are absent in the upper and lower extremities.  Long track signs are absent.  Sensory level is at the C4 dermatome.  Rectal tone is absent.  I discussed the findings with the patient and also the daughter.  We discussed the possibility of this is permanent quadriplegia, but at this time, the compression of the epidural space was warranted and certainly for exploration reasons be sure that there is a hematoma there and they have agreed to proceed with surgery.  They are aware that it is possible she had known permanent neurologic status regardless of my intervention and they have agreed to accept this and has signed the consent form for surgery.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to OR #1 at ABCD General Hospital on a gurney.  Department of Anesthesia administered fiberoptic intubation and general anesthetic.  A Foley catheter was placed in the bladder.  The patient was log rolled in a prone position on the Jackson table.  Bony prominences were well padded.  The patient&#x27;s head was placed in the prone view anesthesia head holder.  At this point, the wound was examined closely and there was hematoma at the caudal pole of the wound.  Next, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The previous skin incision was reopened.  At this point, hematoma properly exits from the wound.  All sutures were removed and the epidural spaces were encountered at this time.  The self-retaining retractors were placed in the depth of the wound.  Consolidated hematoma was now removed from the wound.  Next, the epidural space was encountered.  There was no additional hematoma in the epidural space or on the thecal sac.  A curette was carefully used to scrape along the thecal sac and there was no film or lining covering the sac.  The inferior edge of the C2 lamina was explored and there was no compression at this level and the superior lamina of T1 was explored and again no compression was identified at this area as well.  Next, the wound was irrigated copiously with one liter of saline using a syringe.  The walls of the wound were explored.  There was no active bleeding.  Retractors were removed at this time and even without pressure on the musculature, there was no active bleeding.  A #19 French Hemovac drain was passed percutaneously at this point and placed into the epidural space.  Fascia was reapproximated with #1 Vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissue with #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Steri-Strips covered the incision and dressing was then applied over the incision.  The patient was then log rolled in the supine position on the hospital gurney.  She remained intubated for airway precautions and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  Once in the recovery room, she was alert.  She was following simple commands and using her head to nod, but she did not have any active movement of her upper or lower extremities.  Prognosis for this patient is guarded.&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Neurology&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Neurosurgery&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;3330&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 76-year-old female that was admitted with fever, chills, and left pelvic pain.  The patient was well visiting in ABC, with her daughter that evening.  She had pain in her left posterior pelvic and low back region.  They came back to XYZ the following day.  By the time they got here, she was in severe pain and had fever.  They came straight to the emergency room.  She was admitted.  She had temperature of 104 degrees F.  It has been spiking ever since and she has had left sacroiliac type hip pain.  Multiple blood studies have been done including cultures, febrile agglutinins, etc.  She has had run a higher blood glucose to the normal and she has been on sliding scale insulin.  She was not known previously to be a diabetic.  All x-rays have not been helpful as far as to determine the etiology of her discomfort.  MRIs of the lumbar spine and the pelvis and both thighs have been unremarkable for any inflammatory process.  She does have degenerative disk disease of her lumbar spine but no hip pathology.  She has swollen inguinal nodes bilaterally.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , She was not known to be a diabetic until this admission.  She had been hypertensive.  She has been on medications and has been controlled.  She has not had hyperlipidemia.  She has had no thyroid problems.  There has been no asthma, bronchitis, TB, emphysema or pneumonia.  No tuberculosis.  She has had no breast tumors.  She has had no chest pain or cardiac problems.  She has had gallbladder surgery.  She has not had any gastritis or ulcers.  She has had no kidney disease.  She has had a hysterectomy.  She has had 9 pregnancies and 8 living children.  She had A&amp;amp;P repair.  She had a sacral abscess after a spinal.  It sounds to me like she had a pilonidal cyst, which took about 3 operations to heal.  There have been fractures and no significant arthritis.  She has been quite active at her ranch in Mexico.  She raises goats and cattle.  She drives a tractor and in short, has been very active.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  She is a short female, alert.  She is shivering.  She has ice in her axilla and behind her neck.  She is febrile to 101 degrees F. She is alert.  Her complaint is that of hip pain in the posterior sacroiliac joint area.  She moves both her upper extremities well.  She can move her right leg well.  She actually can move her left hip and knee without much discomfort but the pain radiates from her sacroiliac joint.  She cannot stand, sit or turn without severe pain.  She has normal knee reflexes.  No ankle reflexes.  She has bounding tibial pulses.  No sensory deficit.  She says she knows when she has to void.  She has a healed scar in the upper sacral region.  There is some bruising around the buttocks but the daughter says that is from her being in bed lying on her back.,PLAN: , My plan is to do a triple-phase bone scan.  I am suspecting an infection possibly in the left sacroiliac joint.  It is probably some type of bacterium, the etiology of which is undetermined.  She has had a normal white count despite her fever.  There has been a history of brucellosis in the past, but her titers at this time are negative.  Continue medication which included antibiotics and also the Motrin and Darvocet.,&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;General Medicine&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Neurology&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;2794&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;REASON FOR CONSULT:,  Organic brain syndrome in the setting of multiple myeloma.,SOURCE OF HISTORY:  ,The patient himself is not able to give a good history.  History has obtained through discussion with Dr. X over the phone and the nurse taking care of the patient despite reviewing the chart on the floor.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 56-year-old male with the history of multiple myeloma, who has been admitted for complains of being dehydrated and was doing good until this morning, was found to be disoriented and confused, was not able to communicate properly, and having difficulty leaving out the words.  Not a very clear history at this time and the patient himself is not able to give any history despite no family member was present in the room.  Neurology consult was called to evaluate any organic brain syndrome in the setting of multiple myeloma.  The patient since the morning has improved, but still not completely back to the baseline.  Even I evaluated the patient previously, hence not very sure about his baseline.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  History of IgG subtype multiple myeloma.,SURGICAL HISTORY:,  Nothing significant.,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:  ,Nothing significant.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,No history of any smoking, alcohol or drug abuse.,ALLERGIES: , CODEINE AND FLAGYL.,IMMUNIZATION HISTORY: , Nothing significant.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Unobtainable.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,The patient was considered to ask question for systemic review including neurology, psychiatry, sleep, ENT, ophthalmology, pulmonary, cardiology, gastroenterology, genitourinary, hematology, rheumatology, dermatology, allergy/immunology, endocrinology, toxicology, oncology, and found to be positive for the symptoms mentioned in the history of the presenting illness.  The patient himself is not able to give any history only source is the chart.  For details, please review the chart.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure of 97/54, heart rate of 97, respiratory rate of 19, and temperature 98.5.  The patient on supplemental oxygen was FiO2 on 2 L 96%.  Limited physical examination.,HEENT:  Head, normocephalic and atraumatic.  Throat clear.  No discharge from the ear and the nose.  No discoloration of conjunctivae and the sclerae.,NECK:  Supple.  No signs of any meningismus.  Though a limited examination, the patient does appear to have arthritic changes, questioning contracture deformities, as not able to follow the commands to show full range of motion.  No bruit auscultated over the neck and the orbits.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.,HEART:  Normal heart sounds.,ABDOMEN:  Benign.,EXTREMITIES:  No edema, clubbing or cyanosis.  No rash.  No leptomeningeal or neurocutaneous disorder.,NEUROLOGIC:  Examination is limited.  Mental state examination, the patient is awake, alert, and oriented to himself, not able follow commands, and give a proper history, and still appeared to be confuse and disoriented.  Cranial nerve examination limited, but apparently nonfocal.  Motor examination is very limited except for the grips, which were strong enough.  I was not able to obtain much.  Deep tendon reflexes were not reliable.  Toes equivocal and downgoing.  Sensory examination is not reliable, though intact for painful stimuli with limited examination.  Coordination could not be tested.  Gait could not be tested.,IMPRESSION:,  History of multiple myeloma and altered mental status in multiple myeloma setting.  Rule out brain metastasis including lepto-meningismus, possible transient ischemic attack related to hyperviscosity syndrome or provoked seizure related to ischemia, and delirium related to any electrolyte imbalance or underlying infarction.,PLAN AND RECOMMENDATIONS: , The patient is to continue with current level of management.

After admission, she had a CT of the abdomen done, which showed evidence of diffuse colitis and she was started on IV Flagyl and also on IV Levaquin.  She was also placed on IV Reglan because of nausea and vomiting.  In spite of the above, her white count still continues to be elevated today.  On questioning the patient, she states the nausea and vomiting has resolved, but the diarrhea still present, but otherwise denies any other specific complaints except for some weakness.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent C. diff colitis, which had resolved based on speaking to Dr. X.

Lower extremity Duplex ultrasound.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , Please refer to my H&amp;amp;P for full details.  In brief, the patient is a  64-year-old male with history of diabetes, who presented with 6 hours of chest pressure.  He was brought in by a friend.  The friend states that the patient deteriorated over the last few weeks to the point that he is very short of breath with exertion.  He apparently underwent a cardiac workup 6 months ago that the patient states he barely passed.  His vital signs were stable on admission.  He was ruled out for myocardial infarction with troponin x2.  An echocardiogram showed concentric LVH with an EF of 62%.  I had Cardiology come to see the patient, who reviewed the records from Fountain Valley.  Based on his stress test in the past, Dr. X felt the patient needed to undergo a cardiac cath during his inpatient stay.,The patient on initial presentation complained of, what sounded like, amaurosis fugax.  I performed an MRI, which showed a 1 cm lesion in the right parietal lobe.  I was going to call Neurology at XYZ for evaluation.  However, secondary to his indication for transfer, this could be followed up at ABCD with Dr. Y.,The patient is now stable for transfer for cardiac cath.,Discharged to ABCD.,DISCHARGE CONDITION:,  Stable.,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:,1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily.,2.  Lovenox 40 mg p.o. daily.,3.  Regular Insulin sliding scale.,4.  Novolin 70/30, 15 units b.i.d.,5.  Metformin 500 mg p.o. daily.,6.

The scalp was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The CUSA was brought in to supplement the use of operating microscope as well as the stealth, which was used to localize the tumor.  Following this, we then made a transverse linear incision, the scalp galea was reflected and the quadrilateral bone flap was removed after placing burr holes in the midline and over the parietal areas directly over the tumor.  The bone flap was elevated.  The ultrasound was then used.  The ultrasound showed the tumors directly I believe are in the interhemispheric fissure.  We noticed that the dura was quite tense despite that the patient had slight hyperventilation.  We gave 4 ounce of mannitol, the brain became more pulsatile.  We then used the stealth to perform a ventriculostomy.  Once this was done, the brain began to pulsate nicely.  We then entered the interhemispheric space after we incised the dura in an inverted U fashion based on the superior side of the sinus.  After having done this we then used operating microscope and slight self-retaining retraction was used.  We obtained access to the tumor.  We biopsied this and submitted it.  This was returned as a malignant brain tumor - metastatic tumor, adenocarcinoma compatible with breast cancer.,Following this we then debulked this tumor using CUSA and then removed it in total.  After gross total removal of this tumor, the irrigation was used to wash the tumor bed and a meticulous hemostasis was then obtained using bipolar cautery.  The next step was after removal of this tumor, closure of the wound, a large piece of Duragen was placed over the dural defect and the bone flap was reapproximated and held secured with Lorenz plates.  The tumors self extend into the ventricle and after we had removed the tumor, we could see our ventricular catheter in the occipital horn of the ventricle.  This being the case, we left this ventricular catheter in, brought it out through a separate incision and connected to sterile drainage.  The next step was to close the wound after reapproximating the bone flap.  The galea was closed with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed with interrupted 3-0 nylon sutures inverted with mattress sutures.  The sterile dressings were applied to the scalp.  The patient returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  Hemodynamically remained stable throughout the operation.,Once again, we performed occipital craniotomy, total removal of her large metastatic tumor involving the parietal lobe using a biparietal craniotomy.  The tumor was removed using the combination of CUSA, ultrasound, stealth guided-ventriculostomy and the patient will have a second operation today, we will perform a selective craniectomy to remove another large tumor in the posterior fossa.&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Neurology&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Neurosurgery&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;3760&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;TECHNIQUE: , Sequential axial CT images were obtained from the base of the brain to the thoracic inlet following the uneventful administration of 100 CC Optiray 320 intravenous contrast.,FINDINGS:,  Scans through the base of the brain are unremarkable.  The oropharynx and nasopharynx are within normal limits.  The airway is patent.  The epiglottis and epiglottic folds are normal.  The thyroid, submandibular, and parotid glands enhance homogenously.

The patient presented to the emergency room last evening with approximately 7- to 8-day history of abdominal pain which has been persistent.  She was seen 3 to 4 days ago at ABC ER and underwent evaluation and discharged and had a CT scan at that time and she was told it was &quot;normal.&quot;  She was given oral antibiotics of Cipro and Flagyl.  She has had no nausea and vomiting, but has had persistent associated anorexia.  She is passing flatus, but had some obstipation symptoms with the last bowel movement two days ago.  She denies any bright red blood per rectum and no history of recent melena.  Her last colonoscopy was approximately 5 years ago with Dr. Y. She has had no definite fevers or chills and no history of jaundice.  The patient denies any significant recent weight loss.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Significant for history of atrial fibrillation, under good control and now in normal sinus rhythm and on metoprolol and also on Premarin hormone replacement.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , Significant for cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and hysterectomy.  She has a long history of known grade 4 bladder prolapse and she has been seen in the past by Dr. Chip Winkel, I believe that he has not been re-consulted.,ALLERGIES: , SHE IS ALLERGIC OR SENSITIVE TO MACRODANTIN.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She does not drink or smoke.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Otherwise negative for any recent febrile illnesses, chest pains or shortness of breath.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient is an elderly thin white female, very pleasant, in no acute distress.,VITAL SIGNS:  Her temperature is 98.8 and vital signs are all stable, within normal limits.,HEENT:  Head is grossly atraumatic and normocephalic.  Sclerae are anicteric.  The conjunctivae are non-injected.,NECK:  Supple.,CHEST:  Clear.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.,ABDOMEN:  Generally nondistended and soft.  She is focally tender in the left lower quadrant to deep palpation with a palpable fullness or mass and focally tender, but no rebound tenderness.  There is no CVA or flank tenderness, although some very minimal left flank tenderness.,PELVIC:  Currently deferred, but has history of grade 4 urinary bladder prolapse.,EXTREMITIES:  Grossly and neurovascularly intact.,LABORATORY VALUES:  ,White blood cell count is 5.3, hemoglobin 12.8, and platelet count normal.  Alkaline phosphatase elevated at 184.  Liver function tests otherwise normal.  Electrolytes normal.  Glucose 134, BUN 4, and creatinine 0.7.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:,  EKG shows normal sinus rhythm.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN: , A 71-year-old female with greater than one-week history of abdominal pain now more localized to the left lower quadrant.  Currently is a nonacute abdomen.  The working diagnosis would be sigmoid diverticulitis.  She does have a history in the distant past of sigmoid diverticulitis.  I would recommend a repeat stat CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis and keep the patient nothing by mouth.  The patient was seen 5 years ago by Dr. Y in Colorectal Surgery.  We will consult her also for evaluation.  The patient will need repeat colonoscopy in the near future and be kept nothing by mouth now empirically.  The case was discussed with the patient&#x27;s primary care physician, Dr. X. Again, currently there is no indication for acute surgical intervention on today&#x27;s date, although the patient will need close observation and further diagnostic workup.&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;General Medicine&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Gastroenterology&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;2645&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Vault prolapse and rectocele.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Vault prolapse and rectocele.,OPERATION: , Colpocleisis and rectocele repair.,ANESTHESIA:  ,Spinal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Minimal.,FLUIDS: , Crystalloid.,BRIEF HISTORY OF THE PATIENT: , This is an 85-year-old female who presented to us with a vaginal mass.  On physical exam, the patient was found to have grade 3 rectocele and poor apical support, and history of hysterectomy.  The patient had good anterior support at the bladder.  Options were discussed such as watchful waiting, pessary, repair with and without mesh, and closing of the vagina (colpocleisis) were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, morbidity, and mortality of the procedure were discussed., ,Risk of infection and abscess formation were discussed.  The patient understood all the risks and benefits and wanted to proceed with the procedure.  Risk of retention and incontinence were discussed.  Consent was obtained through the family members.,DETAILS OF THE OR:,  The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient had a Foley catheter placed.  The posterior side of the rectocele was visualized with grade 3 rectocele and poor apical support.  A 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was applied for posterior hydrodissection, which was very difficult to do due to the significant scarring of the posterior part.  Attempts were made to lift the vaginal mucosa off of the rectum, which was very, very difficult to do at this point due to the patient&#x27;s overall poor medical condition in terms of poor mobility and significant scarring.  Discussion was done with the family in the waiting area regarding simply closing the vagina and doing a colpocleisis since the patient is actually inactive.  Family agreed that she is not active and they rather not have any major invasive procedure especially in light of scarring and go ahead and perform the colpocleisis.  Oral consent was obtained from the family and her surgery was preceded.  The vaginal mucosa was denuded off using electrocautery and Metzenbaum scissors.  Using 0 Vicryl, 2 transverse longitudinal stitches were placed to bring the anterior and the posterior part of the vagina together and was started at the apex and was brought all the way out to the introitus.  The vaginal mucosa was pretty much completely closed off all the way up to the introitus.  Indigo carmine was given.  Cystoscopy revealed there was a good efflux of urine from both of the ureteral openings.  There was no injury to the bladder or kinking of the ureteral openings.  The bladder was normal.  Rectal exam was normal at the end of the colpocleisis repair.  There was good hemostasis., ,At the end of the procedure, Foley was removed and the patient was brought to recovery in a stable condition.&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Obstetrics / Gynecology&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Urology&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;3664&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;CHIEF COMPLAINT:, Bright red blood per rectum ,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ,This 73-year-old woman had a recent medical history significant for renal and bladder cancer, deep venous thrombosis of the right lower extremity, and anticoagulation therapy complicated by lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Colonoscopy during that admission showed internal hemorrhoids and diverticulosis, but a bleeding site was not identified. Five days after discharge to a nursing home, she again experienced bloody bowel movements and returned to the emergency department for evaluation. ,REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS: ,No chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain or cramping, nausea, vomiting, or lightheadedness. Positive for generalized weakness and diarrhea the day of admission. ,PRIOR MEDICAL HISTORY:, Long-standing hypertension, intermittent atrial fibrillation, and hypercholesterolemia. Renal cell carcinoma and transitional cell bladder cancer status post left nephrectomy, radical cystectomy, and ileal loop diversion 6 weeks prior to presentation, postoperative course complicated by pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and retroperitoneal bleed. Deep venous thrombosis 2 weeks prior to presentation, management complicated by lower gastrointestinal bleeding, status post inferior vena cava filter placement. ,MEDICATIONS: ,Diltiazem 30 mg tid, pantoprazole 40 mg qd, epoetin alfa 40,000 units weekly, iron 325 mg bid, cholestyramine. Warfarin discontinued approximately 10 days earlier. ,ALLERGIES: ,Celecoxib (rash).,SOCIAL HISTORY:, Resided at nursing home.

The patient had a positive hCG with a negative sonogram and hCG titer of about 18,000.,HOSPITAL COURSE:,  The patient was admitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of a possible incomplete abortion, to rule out ectopic pregnancy or rupture of corpus luteal cyst.  The patient was kept in observation for 24 hours.  The sonogram stated there was no gestational sac, but there was a small mass within the uterus that could represent a gestational sac.  The patient was admitted to the hospital.  A repeat hCG titer done on the same day came back as 15,000, but then the following day, it came back as 18,000.  The diagnosis of a possible ruptured ectopic pregnancy was established.  The patient was taken to surgery and a laparotomy was performed with findings of a right ruptured ectopic pregnancy.  The right salpingectomy was performed with no complications.  The patient received 2 units of red packed cells.  On admission, her hemoglobin was 12.9, then in the afternoon it dropped to 8.1, and the following morning, it was 7.9.  Again, based on these findings, the severe abdominal pain, we made the diagnosis of ectopic and it was proved or confirmed at surgery.  The hospital course was uneventful.  There was no fever reported.  The abdomen was soft.  She had a normal bowel movement.  The patient was dismissed on 09/09/2007 to be followed in my office in 4 days.,FINAL DIAGNOSES:,1.  Right ruptured ectopic pregnancy with hemoperitoneum.,2.  Anemia secondary to blood loss.,PLAN: , The patient will be dismissed on pain medication and iron therapy.&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Obstetrics / Gynecology&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Discharge Summary&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;110&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;1.  Pelvic tumor.,2.  Cystocele.,3.  Rectocele.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Degenerated joint.,2.  Uterine fibroid.,3.  Cystocele.,4.  Rectocele.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,1.  Total abdominal hysterectomy.,2.  Bilateral salpingooophorectomy.,3.  Repair of bladder laceration.,4.  Appendectomy.,5.  Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz cystourethropexy.,6.  Posterior colpoperineoplasty.,GROSS FINDINGS:  The patient had a history of a rapidly growing mass on the abdomen, extending from the pelvis over the past two to three months.  She had a recent D&amp;amp;C and laparoscopy, and enlarged mass was noted and could not be determined if it was from the ovary or the uterus.  Curettings were negative for malignancy.  The patient did have a large cystocele and rectocele, and a collapsed anterior and posterior vaginal wall.,Upon laparotomy, there was a giant uterine tumor extending from the pelvis up to the above the umbilicus compatible with approximately four to five-month pregnancy.  The ovaries appeared to be within normal limits.  There was marked adherence between the bladder and the giant uterus and mass with edema and inflammation, and during dissection, a laceration inadvertently occurred and it was immediately recognized.  No other pathology noted from the abdominal cavity or adhesions.  The upper right quadrant of the abdomen compatible with a previous gallbladder surgery.  The appendix is in its normal anatomic position.  The ileum was within normal limits with no Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum seen and no other gross pathology evident.  There was no evidence of metastasis or tumors in the left lobe of the liver.,Upon frozen section, diagnosis of initial and partial is that of a degenerating uterine fibroid rather than a malignancy.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room, prepped and draped in the low lithotomy position under general anesthesia.  A midline incision was made around the umbilicus down to the lower abdomen.  With a #10 Bard Parker blade knife, the incision was carried down through the fascia.  The fascia was incised in the midline, muscle fibers were splint in the midline, the peritoneum was grasped with hemostats and with a #10 Bard Parker blade after incision was made with Mayo scissors.  A Balfour retractor was placed into the wound.  This giant uterus was soft and compatible with a possible leiomyosarcoma or degenerating fibroid was handled with care.  The infundibular ligament on the right side was isolated and ligated with #0 Vicryl suture brought to an avascular area, doubly clamped and divided from the ovary and the ligament again re-ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The right round ligament was ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, brought to an avascular space within the broad ligament and divided from the uterus.  The infundibulopelvic ligament on the left side was treated in a similar fashion as well as the round ligament.  An attempt was made to dissect the bladder flap from the anterior surface of the uterus and this was remarkably edematous and difficult to do, and during dissection the bladder was inadvertently entered.  After this was immediately recognized, the bladder flap was wiped away from the anterior surface of the uterus.  The bladder was then repaired with a running locking stitch #0 Vicryl suture incorporating serosal muscularis mucosa and then the second layer of overlapping seromuscular sutures were used to make a two-layer closure of #0 Vicryl suture.  After removing the uterus, the bladder was tested with approximately 400 cc of sterile water and there appeared to be no leak.  Progressing and removing of the uterus was then carried out and the broad ligament was clamped bilaterally with a straight Ochsner forceps and divided from the uterus with Mayo scissors, and the straight Ochsner was placed by #0 Vicryl suture thus controlling the uterine blood supply.  The cardinal ligaments containing the cervical blood supply was serially clamped bilaterally with a curved Ochsner forceps, divided from the uterus with #10 Bard Parker blade knife and a curved Ochsner was placed by #0 Vicryl suture.  The cervix was again grasped with a Lahey tenaculum and pubovesicocervical ligament was entered and was divided using #10 Bard Parker blade knife and then the vaginal vault and with a double pointed sharp scissors.  A single-toothed tenaculum was placed on the cervix and then the uterus was removed from the vagina using hysterectomy scissors.  The vaginal cuff was then closed using a running #0 Vicryl suture in locking stitch incorporating all layers of the vagina, the cardinal ligaments of the lateral aspect and uterosacral ligaments on the posterior aspect.  The round ligaments were approximated to the vaginal cuff with #0 Vicryl suture and the bladder flap approximated to the round ligaments with #000 Vicryl suture.  The ______ was re-peritonealized with #000 Vicryl suture and then the cecum brought into the incision.  The pelvis was irrigated with approximately 500 cc of water.  The appendix was grasped with Babcock forceps.  The mesoappendix was doubly clamped with curved hemostats and divided with Metzenbaum scissors.  The curved hemostats were placed with #00 Vicryl suture.  The base of the appendix was ligated with #0 plain gut suture, doubly clamped and divided from the distal appendix with #10 Bard Parker blade knife, and the base inverted with a pursestring suture with #00 Vicryl.  No bleeding was noted.  Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were found to be correct.  All packs and retractors were removed.  The peritoneum muscle fascia was closed in single-layer closure using running looped #1 PDS, but prior to closure, a Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz cystourethropexy was carried out by dissecting the space of Retzius identifying the urethra in the vesical junction approximating the periurethral connective tissue to the symphysis pubis with interrupted #0 Vicryl suture.  Following this, the abdominal wall was closed as previously described and the skin was closed using skin staples.  Attention was then turned to the vagina, where the introitus of the vagina was grasped with an Allis forceps at the level of the Bartholin glands.  An incision was made between the mucous and the cutaneous junction and then a midline incision was made at the posterior vaginal mucosa in a tunneling fashion with Metzenbaum scissors.  The flaps were created bilaterally by making an incision in the posterior connective tissue of the vagina and wiping the rectum away from the posterior vaginal mucosa, and flaps were created bilaterally.  In this fashion, the rectocele was reduced and the levator ani muscles were approximated in the midline with interrupted #0 Vicryl suture.  Excess vaginal mucosa was excised and the vaginal mucosa closed with running #00 Vicryl suture.  The bulbocavernosus and transverse perinei muscles were approximated in the midline with interrupted #00 Vicryl suture.  The skin was closed with a running #000 plain gut subcuticular stitch.  The vaginal vault was packed with a Betadine-soaked Kling gauze sponge.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The patient was sent to recovery room in stable condition.&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Urology&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Obstetrics / Gynecology&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n                    &lt;/div&gt;\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;/tr&gt;\n        &lt;/tbody&gt;\n        \n        &lt;tbody class=&quot;first:border-t border-b border-zinc-400&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;tr class=&quot;gsk-issue text-sm group peer text-left cursor-pointer hover:bg-zinc-700&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;td class=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; stroke-width=&quot;1.5&quot;\n                        stroke=&quot;currentColor&quot; class=&quot;w-4 h-4 group-[.open]:rotate-90&quot;&gt;\n                        &lt;path stroke-linecap=&quot;round&quot; stroke-linejoin=&quot;round&quot; d=&quot;M8.25 4.5l7.5 7.5-7.5 7.5&quot; /&gt;\n                    &lt;/svg&gt;\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n                &lt;td class=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;code class=&quot;mono text-blue-300&quot;&gt;\n                    transcription contains &amp;#39;95&amp;#39;\n                &lt;/code&gt;\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n                &lt;td class=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;\n                    Recall = 0.20\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n                &lt;td class=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;span class=&quot;text-red-400&quot;&gt;\n                        -66.73% than global\n                    &lt;/span&gt;\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n                &lt;td class=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;span class=&quot;text-gray-400&quot;&gt;\n                        19 samples (5.12%)\n                    &lt;/span&gt;\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n                &lt;td class=&quot;p-3 text-xs text-right space-x-1&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;\n                        class=&quot;gsk-debug inline-block border border-emerald-100/50 text-emerald-100/90 hover:bg-emerald-500 hover:border-emerald-500 hover:text-white px-2 py-0.5 rounded-sm&quot;&gt;Debug&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;/tr&gt;\n            &lt;tr class=&quot;gsk-issue-detail text-left collapse peer-[.open]:visible border-b border-zinc-400 bg-zinc-700&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;td colspan=&quot;6&quot; class=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;h4 class=&quot;uppercase&quot;&gt;Examples&lt;/h4&gt;\n                    &lt;div class=&quot;text-white max-w-xl text-sm overflow-scroll&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 920px&quot;&gt;\n                        &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;dataframe&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;transcription&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;medical_specialty&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;predicted_label&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;2601&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Recurrent vulvar melanoma.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Recurrent vulvar melanoma.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Radical anterior hemivulvectomy.  Posterior skinning vulvectomy.,SPECIMENS: , Radical anterior hemivulvectomy, posterior skinning vulvectomy.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , The patient has a history of vulvar melanoma first diagnosed in November of 1995.  She had a surgical resection at that time and recently noted recurrence of an irritated nodule around the clitoris.  Biopsy obtained by The patient confirmed recurrence.  In addition, biopsies on the posterior labia (left side) demonstrated melanoma in situ.,FINDINGS: , During the examination under anesthesia, the biopsy sites were visible and a slightly pigmented irregular area of epithelium was seen near the clitoris.  No other obvious lesions were seen.  The room was darkened and a Woods lamp was used to inspect the epithelium.  A marking pen was used to outline all pigmented areas, which included several patches on both the right and left labia.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was prepped and draped and a scalpel was used to incise the skin on the anterior portion of the specimen.  The radical anterior hemivulvectomy was designed so that a 1.5-2.0 cm margin would be obtained and the depth was carried to the fascia of the urogenital diaphragm.  Subcutaneous adipose was divided with electrocautery and the specimen was mobilized from the periosteum.  After removal of the radical anterior portion, the skin on the posterior labia and perineal body was mobilized.  Skin was incised with a scalpel and electrocautery was used to undermine.  After removal of the specimen, the wounds were closed primarily with subcutaneous interrupted stitches of 3-0 Vicryl suture.  The final sponge, needle, and instrument counts were correct at the completion of the procedure.  The patient was then taken to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Obstetrics / Gynecology&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Urology&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;3396&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;DISCHARGE DATE:  MM/DD/YYYY,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. ABC is a 60-year-old white male veteran with multiple comorbidities, who has a history of bladder cancer diagnosed approximately two years ago by the VA Hospital.
